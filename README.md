# TVshows
<h2>TV shows is a website that I made using python flask that is about users psoting their ratings of TV shows and ratings and viewing others ratings too.</h2>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>I learned how to make a MySQL DB that saves a users data and make new users with it. I learned how to route, stylize, work and connect 
the front-end and the back-end of the servers using MySQL and Python.</p>
